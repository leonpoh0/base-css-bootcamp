      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control over them. JavaScript
        contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math,
        and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
        example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
          to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
          client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
          HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
          and page navigation.

      <h1>What you should already know</h1>
      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).
        </li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>
          Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of
          the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.
        </li>
      </ul>

        if...else statement Use the if statement to execute a statement if a
        logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause to execute a
        statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
        if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; } condition can be
        any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an
        explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates
        to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise, statement_2 is executed.
        statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further
        nested if statements. You may also compound the statements using else if
        to have multiple conditions tested in sequence, as follows: if
        (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2; }
        else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; } In the
        case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
        evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements,
        group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good
        practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if
        statements: if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; } It is advisable to not use
        simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment
        can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example,
        do not use the following code: if (x = y) { /* statements here */ } If
        you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common
        practice is to put additional parentheses around the assignment. For
        example: if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ } while statement A while
        statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
        evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows: while (condition)
        statement If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop
        stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while. To execute multiple
        statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.
        Example: The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than
        three: var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n < 3) { n++; x += n; } With each
        iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x
        and n take on the following values: After the first pass: n = 1 and x =
        1 After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3 After the third pass: n = 3 and
        x = 6 After completing the third pass, the condition n < 3 is no longer
        true, so the loop terminates. Function declarations A function
        definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement)
        consists of the function keyword, followed by: The name of the function.
        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
        separated by commas. The JavaScript statements that define the function,
        enclosed in curly brackets, { }. For example, the following code defines
        a simple function named square: function square(number) { return number
        * number; } The function square takes one argument, called number. The
        function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of
        the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
        statement specifies the value returned by the function. return number *
        number; Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions
        by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
        changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
        globally or in the calling function.
